## What is a draft jam?

Draft Jam is a mostly-online community project run by [Melanie Richards](http://melanie-richards.com) <span aria-hidden="true">üë©‚Äçü¶∞</span>. I wanted to accomplish two things: write more blog posts, and encourage more people to share their perspective online. I find that it can be easier to commit to activities‚Äîlike working out or writing‚Äîwhen there is some kind of communal accountability involved. Enter draft jams!

A draft jam is a day in which folks can set aside time to work on their draft blog post ideas, as well as share their progress and find collaborators on social media. The concept borrows from ‚Äúgame jams‚Äù, where designers and developers create games within a concentrated period of time.

## How to participate

During the time period chosen for the jam, work on some blog posts! You can spend this time outlining, researching, writing, creating imagery, editings‚Äîwhatever is needed to turn your drafts into new blog posts. Use the hashtag #draftJam on Twitter, Mastodon, or elsewhere to share how things are going. You can use #draftJamPartners to find collaborators or peer-reviewers. Throughout the jam, we‚Äôll check in and share content on [@DraftJamSocial on Twitter](https://twitter.com/draftjamsocial).

Draft Jam times specify a time range in the PST time zone (UTC-7), and this is when the social media account will be moderated. Feel free to participate during the posted times, or you can adjust for whatever is most comfortable for your time zone‚Äîthis is your jam!

Because yours truly is local to Seattle, WA, there will likely be an in-person meetup in the Seattle area, once it is safe to do so.

## Submitting your posts

You can submit your own posts for inclusion in the [archives @TODO: add a link]. You don‚Äôt need to start and finish a post within the jam for it to be included; any amount of work during the jam is fine. There is no deadline for submissions.

You can submit your posts either via Github or via email. Either way, I‚Äôll do a quick skim to make sure your submission aligns with the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/melanierichards/draftjam.com/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before adding it to the list. Note: if I‚Äôve missed content you think might be inappropriate, please email me with the details at info@draftjam.com.

### Via PRs on Github

If you‚Äôre comfortable with Github and JSON files, you can submit your own posts directly.

@TODO: add details here once archives are stood up

### Via email

Email info@draftjam.com with the following information about your blog post:

* Which ‚Äújam‚Äù the post is for (e.g. ‚ÄúSeptember 2020‚Äù)
* Title
* Author names
* URL (if you‚Äôve cross-posted on multiple sites, e.g. your own site and Medium, your own site URL is preferred)
* Description, 160 characters or fewer
* Up to 3 tags appropriate for this post (e.g. ‚ÄúWeb design‚Äù, ‚ÄúFigma‚Äù)

## Removing your posts

Draft Jam will honor any requests to take down post information, as long as that information is submitted via the same avenue (so I can be sure it came from you). For example, if you submitted your post via email, please make the request using the same email address you submitted the post from.

## Code of Conduct
The [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/melanierichards/draftjam.com/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) governs all submissions to this project, over Github and email. While I can‚Äôt enforce this policy on social media sites (short of reporting content) due to lack of platform control, I ask that all participants be mindful of this code of conduct and help create an inclusive community when using Draft Jam hash tags.
